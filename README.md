# Machine-Learning-Tutorial

A beginner-friendly tutorial on Machine Learning algorithms with raw python implemetation

Project Structure:<br>
**Separate directories for each algorithm<br>
**Each directory has files of form "algorithm_name.py" and "algorithm_name_usingsk.py"<br>
**"algorithm_name.py" contains raw implementation of the algo using only NumPy and Pandas<br>
**"algorithm_name_usingsk.py" makes use of ScikitLearn library functions for the same<br>
**Extra material has been provided to understand some tricky concepts<br>
**requirements.txt mentions all the libraries I have used in this repo
