# Machine-Learning-Tutorial

A beginner-friendly tutorial on Machine Learning algorithms with raw python implemetation

Project Structure:
**Separate directories for each algorithm
**Each directory has files of form "algorithm_name.py" and "algorithm_name_usingsk.py"
**"algorithm_name.py" contains raw implementation of the algo using only NumPy and Pandas
**"algorithm_name_usingsk.py" makes use of ScikitLearn library functions for the same
**Extra material has been provided to understand some tricky concepts
**requirements.txt mentions all the libraries I have used in this repo
