** Importance of choosing an appropriate learning rate **
1. If the learning rate is too high, the model jumps too far
   and may not converge
2. If the learning rate is too low, the model takes tiny steps
   and will take too many epochs to learn


** How to choose the appropriate learning rate **
1. Start with a value between 0.01-0.001 (Recommended for most cases)
2. Make use of the plot of cost function vs epochs
3. If the curve is diverging in nature, reduce the learning rate
4. If the loss decreases too slowly, increase the learning rate

** Importance of choosing an appropriate epoch **
1. If the epochs are too low, the model stops early and will not
   learn
2. If the epochs are too high, the model will work very slowly

** How to set an ideal epoch **
1. Start with a value around 500-5000 (Works for most cases)
2. Make use of the plot of cost function vs epochs
3. If the cost function attains a stable value early on, no need
   to increase the epochs
4. If the cost function is still decreasing continually, increase
   the epochs so that model can complete learning
